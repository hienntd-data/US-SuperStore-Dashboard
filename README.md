# US-SuperStore-Dashboard
I analyzed the sales and profit of a Supermarket in the United States during a four-year period. In Power BI, I summarized my findings in five reports. I utilized five reports since I didn't want to squeeze too much information into one. The reports are organized as follows:
* Sales by category and sub-category
* Analysis of least profitable sub-categories
* Geographical analysis
* Product analysis
## Result
